# Alternative ripgrep config file name
# Same as .rgrc - some people prefer this name
# Symlink this or use .rgrc (both work)

# This file intentionally left minimal - use .rgrc as the main config
# Include this line to load the main config if using this filename:
# See .rgrc for full configuration
